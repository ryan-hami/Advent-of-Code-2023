# day 5

i was planning to do today in zig, but it is 7pm and i have an exam in 12 hours

also i wanna get this over with and kotlin is super easy to use and i don't really know zig lol...

if i use zig tomorrow that means the exam went well. if it didn't go well i'll probably end up using kotlin again or c++
